# Chest-Pneumonia-Diagnosis-using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to diagnose chest pneumonia using chest x-ray images. The model was trained on te Kaggle chest x-ray dataset and was developped using Google Colaboratory.

## Data
The data for this project was obtained from the Kaggle chest x-ray dataset, it was uploaded to google colab using the Kaggle API.

## Model
The model used in this project is a Convolutional neural network, it was trained on the dataset in order to classify chest x-ray images as either Normal or Pneumonia.

## Result
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set. The evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, are reported in the Model Evaluation directory.
